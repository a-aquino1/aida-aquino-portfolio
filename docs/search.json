Additionally since I want to be comparing the flight patterns and how whether public or school holidays create a greater surge of passengers I decided to filter out the public holidays. As every school district follows a different calendar systems and may have unique holidays, I decided to make a list of the four major schools breaks that students may experience. As stated before since schools have dfferent calendars I decided to be vague on wen these breaks occur, an not focus on specifics since every school have different academic calendars."

The schools breaks are categories per their respective month while public holidays are everything else that is not in the respective month of the school breaks. The graph depict a visual of the average monthly passengers per school break or holiday. It seems as though during summer break there is an increase of passengers. Apart from winter break it does seems that school breaks have an influence on how many people choose to travel."

    "text": "How Passenger Numbers Fluctuate Around Major U.S Holidays\nSolely focusing on the most major holidays celebrated in the U.S we can determine the average passengers that traveled. Additionally choosing to not include the day after or before was a choice made to be able to determine how many travel the day of the major holiday.\nBy excluding the major holidays celebrated in the United States then well will be able to obtain the average or normal rate of passengers traveled.\nNow comparing the normal travel trend with the major holiday trend to see how many travel the day of and how it compares to the other days. There are certain peaks on the graph indicating a major holiday showed an increase in passengers on flights. With the highest peak being around July we can assume fourth of July is a holiday in which many choose to travel, it is also during the summer which reinforces the idea of the previous graph, summer being a popular time to travel."
